            <b>What is C Programming?</b>
            <br>
            <li>C programming is a popular, widely-used and general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity, efficiency, and low-level programming capabilities. C has had a significant influence on the development of many other programming languages and systems, including C++, C#, and even the Unix operating system.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Here are some key features and characteristics of the C programming language:</li>
            <br>
            <b><li>Procedural Programming:</b> C is primarily a procedural programming language, which means that it focuses on writing functions or procedures that manipulate data. It follows a top-down approach to problem-solving.</li>
            <br>
            <b><li>Standard Library:</b> C comes with a standard library that provides a set of functions for performing common tasks, such as input/output operations, string manipulation, and mathematical calculations.</li>
            <br>
            <b><li>Low-Level Programming:</b>C provides a high degree of control over computer hardware and memory, making it suitable for systems programming and embedded systems development.</li>
            <br>
            <b><li>Structured Programming:</b>While C is procedural, it also supports structured programming constructs like functions, loops, and conditional statements, which help in writing organized and maintainable code.</li>
            <br>
            <b><li>Pointers:</b> C is known for its extensive use of pointers, which are variables that store memory addresses. Pointers allow for direct memory manipulation and are a powerful feature of the language.</li>
            </ul>
