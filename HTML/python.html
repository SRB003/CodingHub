        <b>What is Python Programming?</b>
        <br>
        Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. 
        <br>
        Here are some key features of python:
        <br>
        <b>Easy to code:</b> Python is a very developer-friendly language which means that anyone can learn to code it.  
        <br>
        <b>Open source and free:</b> It is an open-source programming language that is anyone can create and contribute to itâ€™s development. 
        <br>
        <b>Object-oriented Approach: </b>It recognizes the concept of class and object encapsulation. 
        <br>
        <b>Support for another language:</b> Being coded in C, Python by default support the execution of code written in other programming language such as Java, C and C++. 
        <br>
        <b>High-level language:</b> This means no need to aware of the coding structure, architecture as well as memory management while coding Python. 
        <br>
        <b>Support for GUI ( Graphical User Interface) :</b> GUI has the ability to add flair to code and make the results more visual.  
        Highly portable
