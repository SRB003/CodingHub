        What is Java?
        <br>
        Java is a most popular, object-oriented, widely used programming language and platform that is utilized for Android development, web development, artificial intelligence, cloud applications, and much more. So, mastering this gives you great opportunities in bigger organizations.
        <br>
        Here are some key characteristics and features of Java:
        <br>
        Platform Independence: 
        <br>
        Java achieves platform independence by compiling source code into an intermediate form called bytecode, which can be executed on any system that has a compatible JVM installed.
        <br>
        Object-Oriented: 
        <br>
        Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which means it encourages the use of objects, classes, and inheritance to build modular and reusable code.
        <br>
        Robust and Secure:
        <br>
        Java's strong type system and memory management make it robust by preventing common programming errors. It also has built-in security features that help protect against malicious code.
        <br>
        Multi-threading: 
        <br>
        Java provides built-in support for multi-threading, making it easier to write programs that can perform multiple tasks concurrently.
        <br>
        Standard Library:
        <br>
        Java comes with a rich standard library that includes packages and classes for a wide range of tasks, such as networking, file I/O, and GUI development.
        <br>
        Garbage Collection:
        <br>
        Java's automatic garbage collection feature manages memory by reclaiming unused objects, reducing the risk of memory leaks.
        <br>
        Community and Ecosystem:
        <br>
        Java has a large and active developer community, which has led to a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools. This ecosystem includes popular frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, and JavaFX.
        <br>
        Cross-Platform GUI:
        <br>
        Java provides libraries like Swing and JavaFX for developing cross-platform graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
        <br>
        Scalability:
        <br>
        Java is used extensively in enterprise-level applications, web services, and large-scale systems due to its scalability and performance capabilities.
        <br>
        Versatility:
        <br>
        Java can be used for a wide range of applications, including desktop applications, web development (Java Servlets and JavaServer Pages), mobile app development (Android apps), and server-side programming (Java EE).
        <br>
        Community Support: 
        <br>
        Java has a rich online community with abundant resources, forums, and documentation to help developers.
        <br>
        Java has remained a popular choice for software development in various domains, including web development, mobile app development, big data, and cloud computing. While newer programming languages have emerged, Java continues to be a crucial technology in the software development landscape
