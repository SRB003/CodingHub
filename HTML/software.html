        <h1>What is Software Testing ?</h1>
        <p>
            Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying a software application or system to ensure that it functions correctly and meets the specified requirements. It is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle that aims to identify defects, errors, or discrepancies in the software's behavior, functionality, or performance.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Key Characteristics and Features of Software Testing:</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            
            <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Software testing has the primary objective of identifying and reporting defects or issues in a software application to ensure its quality and reliability.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Types of Testing:</strong> Software testing encompasses various types, including functional testing, non-functional testing, manual testing, automated testing, regression testing, and more, each with its specific focus and goals.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Test Planning:</strong> Before testing begins, a comprehensive test plan is created to define the scope, objectives, resources, and schedule for testing. Test cases and scripts are also developed during this phase.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Execution:</strong> Testers execute test cases and record the results, identifying discrepancies and defects. The results are communicated to the development team for resolution.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Defect Tracking:</strong> A defect tracking system is used to log and manage identified defects. Each defect is assigned a severity level, and the development team works on fixing them.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> Software testing is an iterative process, and feedback from testing helps improve the software. Multiple rounds of testing may be conducted to ensure reliability.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Comprehensive documentation of test cases, test plans, and test results is crucial for traceability, auditing, and future reference.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Once testing is complete and critical defects are addressed, the software undergoes validation to ensure it meets the intended requirements.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> After any changes are made to the software, regression testing is often performed to verify that modifications did not introduce new defects into previously tested functionality.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Test automation tools and scripts are used to execute repetitive test cases efficiently and consistently.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Load and Performance Testing:</strong> Specialized testing focuses on assessing how the software performs under various loads and conditions, ensuring scalability and reliability.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>User Acceptance Testing (UAT):</strong> End-users may conduct UAT to determine if the software meets their needs and expectations.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Security Testing:</strong> A critical aspect of software testing involves evaluating the software's security to protect against vulnerabilities and malicious attacks.</li>
        </ul>
